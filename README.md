This README file is to tell you about how I took the original HTML and 
made it meet accessability requirements. First I added 'alt' tags to each
of the images so that people with screen readers could hear what an image
is displaying. Then I took all of the 'div' tags and made them more semantic
by renaming them with discriptive elements. Then, in the CSS file, i took all
of the reoccurring code and consolidated it, condensing many lines of the code,
for quality and convenience purposes.
